# Global-Covid-19-Tracker

# 📌 Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data, including:

✔ Cases & Deaths (total and daily trends)

✔ Vaccination Progress (by country)

✔ Death Rates & Case Density (per million population)

✔ Interactive Choropleth Maps (global visualization)

Built with Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly).

#📊 Key Features

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Filters country-level data (excludes continents/income groups)

Handles missing values via forward-filling

# Computes derived metrics:
Death Rate (total_deaths / total_cases)

Cases per Million ((total_cases / population) * 1e6)

Vaccination Rate (people_vaccinated / population)

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time-series trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations

Comparative analysis across countries (US, India, Brazil, UK, Kenya, South Africa)

7-day moving averages for smoothing daily fluctuations

# Interactive Visualizations

Line charts (Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Bar plots (death rates, vaccination progress)

Choropleth maps (Plotly) for global case/vaccination distribution

# Dependencies

Package	& Purpose
